NumPy is a Python library.

NumPy is used for working with arrays.

NumPy is short for "Numerical Python".




---------
Importing NumPy
To start using NumPy, you need to import it into your Python environment. Conventionally, it's imported with the alias np, like so:
python

"import numpy as np"
This line allows you to access NumPy's functions and classes using the np prefix.





-----------------------------------------------INDEXING---------------------------------------------------

Array indexing in NumPy allows you to access individual elements or subarrays within a NumPy array. Here's how it works:

1. **Accessing Individual Elements**:
   
   You can access individual elements of a NumPy array using square brackets and the index of the element you want to access. Remember, indexing in Python starts from 0.
   ```python
   import numpy as np

   arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
   print(arr[0])  # Accesses the first element, prints 1
   print(arr[3])  # Accesses the fourth element, prints 4
   ```

2. **Slicing**:
   
   NumPy also allows you to access subarrays, or slices, of an array using the colon (`:`) operator.
   ```python
   import numpy as np

   arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
   print(arr[1:4])  # Accesses elements from index 1 to 3, prints [2, 3, 4]
   ```

   Slicing syntax is `[start:stop:step]`, where `start` is the starting index, `stop` is the stopping index (exclusive), and `step` is the step size. If any of these are omitted, they default to the beginning, end, and a step of 1, respectively.

3. **Negative Indexing**:
   
   You can also use negative indices to access elements from the end of the array.
   ```python
   import numpy as np

   arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
   print(arr[-1])  # Accesses the last element, prints 5
   ```

4. **Multi-dimensional Arrays**:
   
   For multi-dimensional arrays, you can use a comma-separated tuple of indices or slices to access elements.
   ```python
   import numpy as np

   arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
   print(arr[0, 1])  # Accesses element at row 0, column 1, prints 2
   ```

   You can also use slicing for multi-dimensional arrays.
   ```python
   import numpy as np

   arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
   print(arr[:, 1])  # Accesses elements from all rows, column 1, prints [2, 5]
   ```

These are the basics of array indexing in NumPy. It's a powerful feature that allows you to efficiently access and manipulate data within arrays.
